This project underscores the paramount importance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with Computer Vision (CV) methodologies for detecting driver alertness and preventing accidents. With over forty percent of car accidents attributed to driver inattention, our proposed predictive drowsiness system aims to mitigate accidents caused by fatigue-induced monotony. Leveraging advanced CV algorithms alongside CNNs, our system detects signs of fatigue or sleep and implements timely interventions. CNNs, integrated into driver management systems, play a pivotal role in preempting accidents by monitoring driver behavior and vehicle dynamics. Additionally, the synergistic utilization of CNNs and CV methodologies, represents indispensable tools for preventing accident and implementing anti-collision measures in transportation safety.
